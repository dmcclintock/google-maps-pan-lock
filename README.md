google-maps-pan-lock
====================

Designed to provide a slightly more user-friendly UX for webpages with embeded Google Maps. Essentially, it "locks" the panning and other map control events (on scroll or swipe) for Google Maps when embedded on a webpage for both desktop and mobile devices. At the user's discretion, an onClick/Touch event will unlock the map allowing them to access map controls (pan, zoom, etc.). The map will return to it's initial "locked" state when map control is no longer desired, in order to prevent users from getting stuck in mapland.
